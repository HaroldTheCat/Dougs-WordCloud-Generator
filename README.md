# Dougs WordCloud Generator
 A python based txt file to wordcloud generator with GUI.
This was made as a school project and will allow you to convert TXT files to a word cloud image. 
It allows you to choose a background color, the amount of words in your cloud, the colors of the text in the cloud as well as the resolution.
Currently It has a test feature included, so that all functionality will be tested upon program close. Will be remove at a later date. 

This uses the very smart python package by 
Mueller, A. C. (2023). Wordcloud (Version 1.9.1) [Computer software]. https://github.com/amueller/wordcloud

This is simply a GUI that implements his code, and prepares files for processing. 

For my Programing teacher that may look at this, no I did not plagerize this, this is my repo. I did not copy myself.
