 A python based txt file to wordcloud generater with GUI.
This was made as a school project and will allow you to convert TXT files to a word cloud image. 
It allows you to choose a background color, the amount of words in your cloud, the colors of the text in the cloud as well as the resolution.
Currently It has a test feature included, so that all functionality will be tested upon program close. Will be remove at a later date. 

This uses the very smart python package by 
Mueller, A. C. (2023). Wordcloud (Version 1.9.1) [Computer software]. https://github.com/amueller/wordcloud
